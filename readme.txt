This zip file contains the example datasets for use with the book 'Using R for Statistics' 
by Sarah Stowell and published by Apress (IBSN: 978-1-4842-0140-4). 

The file 'Using_R_for_Statistics.RData' is an R Workspace file that contains all of the 
datasets used in the book (except for the supermarkets dataset, as it is left as an 
exercise for the reader to import this dataset into R). You will learn how to Import R 
Workspace files in Chapter 1 (under "Workspaces").

The 'Individual Datasets' folder contains each of the datasets in individual csv files.
The supermarkets dataset is also available in tab-delimited format (supermarkets.txt) 
and a custom format (supermarkets2.txt). You will learn how to import plain text files in 
Chapter 2 (under "Importing Plain Text Files").
